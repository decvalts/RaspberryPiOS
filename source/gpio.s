GetGpioAddress:

SetGpioFunction:
cmp r0,#53            ;check that r0 value is <=53
cmpls r1,#7           ;check that r1<=7
; the ls suffix above tells cmp to execute only if
; previous cmp function was true (less than)
movhi pc,lr
; similarly hi means mov only executes if previous
; comparison is higher

push {lr}         ;copy value of lr onto the top of stack
mov r2,r0
bl GetGpioAddress ;sets value of lr to next instruction 
                  ;then branches to GetGpioAddress

functionLoop$:
  cmp r2,#9         ;compares pin number to 9
  subhi r2,#10      ;if higher, subtract 10
  addhi r0,#4       ;if higher, add 4 to GPIO address
  bhi functionLoop$ ;run the check again

;r2 will now contain a number from 0-9
;r0 will contain address in GPIO controller
;This would be the same as GPIO Controller Address + 4 ร (GPIO Pin Number รท 10)
